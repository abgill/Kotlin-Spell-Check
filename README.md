# Kotlin_Trie
A simple spell checker written in Kotlin. Takes 2 commandline params: the word being checked against the dictionary, and the path to the dictionary file.  Right now it only acceps newline seperated lists of words that don't contain any non-letter chars. I plan on changing this in the near future.  I also plan on improving suggestion ordering based on how often words appear in texts.
